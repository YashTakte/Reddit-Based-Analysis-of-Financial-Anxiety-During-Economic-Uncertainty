One thing to consider is the job.  Is it in the field you want, and are you doing what you want to do?  While money is important in the short term, what is more important (in these first few years) is the experience and development you'll get.

The money will follow if your skills improve, and it will ramp up quickly over the next few years.   Make sure you are learning and gaining the right training, in any job, before considering changes.

If they say no, but the job was what you were looking for, go for it and stick with it for two years or so, then move on.  Get the experience you want then trade up - note that you'd probably be doing this anyway.

There's a push now to change this, but it's coming from the younger workers who think it's unfair not to have ""equality"" with their peers... not from the people who have run the businesses for decades and are in charge of hiring and pay.

Then a few weeks later you talked to your friends and now you are unhappy with the deal.  The company didn't change.  The position didn't change.  Your attitude changed solely because someone else got a better deal than you did and that turned you from being happy to unhappy.

IMHO, you made the deal, you honor the deal, you remain happy for getting pay you thought was good for a company you like, and you be happy for the friends of yours who are getting paid more than you.

I was involved in hiring some new grads, and a few months later (after the first new hires had started work)  the pay scale for that position was bumped up pretty substantially and other new grads were hired at a much higher rate. I was able to take this up the chain with my management and asked that the original people get a pay bump to bring them up to pay parity the the other new grads, and this was done.  

So, I wouldn't rule out that the company would be willing to up your starting salary.   I would approach this by saying that you've noticed that since you accepted your offer, the market rate seems to have increased for new grads with your skill set, and you've seen that many of your classmates are now getting higher offers.  (Do NOT mention anything about knowing that there are other students that THEY have offered more money.)  So you were wondering if perhaps ZZZ company has also increased its pay range for entry level EEs, and if so would they be able to increase the amount they had previously offered you.  

If they say no, and you decide to still work there, then you are making a choice that you want to do that work even if you will be ""underpaid"".  But when you come up for your first performance review and raise, ask your supervisor where your salary falls relative to the average pay range for your level, and if it's below average but your performance is above average, use that to ask for an above-average raise.  If you still don't feel you are being paid fairly, you can re-assess your career options at that time.  Lots of young people do some job hopping to get the best compensation package they can. 

However, I will also tell you that no to applicants are ""exactly the same"" and just because you got the same degree from the same school, perhaps some of them have other desirable qualities that you don't, that allowed them to negotiate higher starting salaries.

They requested no gifts (although many brought gifts anyway), the yard was so pretty, they didn't need decorations, they set up a mix of chairs and blankets on the ground for folks to sit on. They also requested people be comfortably dressed, but not necessarily casual (aka, no one showed up gym clothes)

The wedding really only costed them about 2K total, and it might have even been less. The guests felt no pressure and felt free to casually socialize in a relaxed way. The bride and groom weren't stressed out about money, or schedules. 

She went ahead and DID buy her dream dress, and he looked spiffy in his comfortable suit, the maid of honor wore a dress she already had and felt comfortable in. Friends took pictures on their phones and with their cameras they brought.

My husband got very ill before the wedding and we had to spend our savings.  After his recovery, it was important for us to have the wedding with all family and friends together rather than reducing the size of our guest list which was not overly large at 100.  Family was spread out and not local and weddings and funerals are the only time everyone is together.  Due to my husband's illness, we had a different perspective of being aware that life is short and we wanted to spend our time with those we loved even if we had some debt as a result.  

Cut wedding expenses where you can without excluding people.  Instead of a full bar, have only beer and wine.  A buffet may be less expensive than a sit down meal.  We kept the sit down meal, but had a dessert buffet.   If you are planning a 4-hour reception, maybe you can reduce it to 3 hours.  Less fancy place settings and centerpieces may be an option.

You need balance in your life.  To many, a wedding is just a one day party, but to us, it was an amazing once-in-a-lifetime experience with family and friends and memories to last a lifetime.  WE have never regretted it.

It was an absolute dream of a day, but was it worth $10k? You'll have to ask me in 10 years to really know. That said, if you do decide to pursue having a wedding, I don't know if any of these ideas are right for you, but here's a few things we found to help cut costs back:

•Consider just beer/wine instead of a full bar. Buy it yourself and just hire a bartender (like $50 an hour in my area.) We found a liquor store that would even let us return the unopened bottles the next day. 

•Look for non-traditional catering options. Do you need a plated dinner or could you do a taco bar from the local Mexican place and still be perfeclty happy? Consider options that are meaningful to you as a couple so you have a good reason you're serving it vs. the traditional protein+3 (like maybe your first trip together was to city known for BBQ, so that's why you're serving BBQ.)

•We found a custom dress could be made for less than off-the-rack options and the timeline was better, too. But also consider other non-traditional dresses, too.

•The minute you say ""wedding,"" a lot of venues and vendors get more expensive. So consider the courthouse option for the ceremony, but then just throw a ""party""/reception with friends and family later.

•You're a grown-ass human marrying another grown-ass human. You don't need a wedding party to stand up there with you for support (and then you definitely don't need to help pay for their dresses/tuxes/etc.) Most of our friends thanked us for not burdening them with obligations. 

•We got a bunch of friends to all plant various flowers (zinnias, marigolds, etc.). Between all the houses, we had plenty to create the arrangements ourselves. Was lucky we had a friend with experience in that area, though. 

•We invited people out to dinner the night before the wedding. But it wasn't a ""rehearsal dinner"" so we didn't feel obligated to pick up the tab.",got married month ago absolute dream day worth k youll ask year really know said decide pursue wedding dont know idea right here thing found help cut cost back consider beerwine instead full bar buy hire bartender like hour area found liquor store would even let u return unopened bottle next day look nontraditional catering option need plated dinner could taco bar local mexican place still perfeclty happy consider option meaningful couple good reason youre serving v traditional protein like maybe first trip together city known bbq thats youre serving bbq found custom dress could made less offtherack option timeline better also consider nontraditional dress minute say wedding lot venue vendor get expensive consider courthouse option ceremony throw partyreception friend family later youre grownass human marrying another grownass human dont need wedding party stand support definitely dont need help pay dressestuxesetc friend thanked u burdening obligation got bunch friend plant various flower zinnia marigold etc house plenty create arrangement lucky friend experience area though invited people dinner night wedding wasnt rehearsal dinner didnt feel obligated pick tab

My uncle is a minister and he married us.  We had a bbq with burgers and hot dogs on the grill, chips, baked beans, coleslaw, potato salad, fruit and veggie trays, all made by the women in my family.  Cake was a sheet cake for $25 from Sam’s Club. My uncle’s church loaned us folding chairs for the field.  My dress came from Ross it was like $20, my husband wore khakis, a white dress shirt, dress shoes and a tie he already had, our groomsmen wore the same and they had it, my bridesmaids wore $20 sun dresses they could wear again and not break the bank.  I bought their dresses for them as a thank you because they were so affordable, I didn’t want them spending money for helping me out. We cleaned out a storage barn where we stored tractors and turned that into a reception area with loaned tables and chairs again from my uncles church.  Our DJ was Spotify and Amazon Music through a Bluetooth speaker, decorations in the barn were clear Christmas lights and mason jars (also already had on hand) of wildflowers.  My bouquet and my bridesmaids were all from flowers we grew on the farm.  

All in all we had a fantastic wedding/ reception for under 1k, including food and a few kegs.  People still talk about our unconventional but absolutely beautiful wedding. It was so much fun, nobody was stuck being in uncomfortable formal clothes, nobody had to go broke with wedding attire, everyone got to relax, have a good time and celebrate the fact we were joining our lives together and celebrate us being happy and in love. Honestly,  it was one of the best days of my life and we took the money we saved from having a fun, laid back wedding to plunk down on a house.  I would take a house over a fancy party any day.

I'm sorry about your predicament. Typically the wedding day is not as exciting in hindsight (you'll likely be stressed the day of everything going right if you're putting that much pressure on it) and i can't imagine your stress afterwards of dealing with the debt. My other viewpoint is if you are super excited about that day, it's going to be perfect anyway. My wife and I come from families where we typically do a large wedding (200-300 people), we ended up doing family only (covid and other reasons) and it was perfect. My gut tells me that no matter what we did, we would have felt it was perfect because the day was special for us and to us (and we weren't doing it for anyone else). 

Given the two families have only offered $1,000 combined, something tells me there is not a good financial foundation / history to stand on, so I think it is fair for you to hear from internet strangers telling you that going into debt for a wedding is quite honestly crazy and something that consumerism has sucked the country into.

My advice is to do courthouse or a yard, and a large lunch or dinner with family celebrating, and can do a dinner the following night or week with your friend group. Then plan if your finances work out to do a big event for a 5 or 10 year anniversary.

I'll add you didn't provide your finances so not everyone will be able to comment, but given you said you'd go into debt over 20k, I'm guessing you have less than saved / invested.

We didn’t have an extravagant wedding (our rehearsal dinner was at TGI Friday’s).  The reception is a blur.  I remember very little because the DJ wanted us for the first dance, the the photographer wanted us for the cake, and ….  We barely were able to eat, and we talked with a bunch of people that we haven’t talked to since.  My wife feels the same way.  

We watched our wedding video once just to see if something I did during our first dance that was an inside joke between my wife and I was caught by the videographer.  The wedding photos are nice, but they sit in an album.  We have one picture on display in the house.  

DO NOT GO INTO DEBT TO FULFILL A FANTASY.  It won’t matter 10 minutes after the reception is done.  

When I was still living at home with my parents, a neighbor girl was married.  They didn’t have a lot of money so they had a wedding at home.  The neighbors got together and made it a pot luck dinner.  35 years later and I still remember most of the details vividly.  I also worked at a banquet hall in the 80s and 90s and every wedding was the same.  There was nothing really special about it and it causes so much stress for everyone.  I can’t count the times I saw the bride and groom break into the envelope box to pull out cash to pay for the reception.

We had a similarly sized and priced (in the end we wound up paying 26k total) wedding as the one you're describing and I was feeling similar dread. The wedding basically absorbed our entire years worth of discretionary spending, but we planned it a year in advance and walked into our weekend with the debt paid off. So basically 1 year worth of saving to cover it. That said it was actually far more worth it than I expected. We had a perfect weekend, and we, our family and our guests had a great time. We put a lot of emphasis on the experience and it was like 3 days of everyone being together and having fun before everyone started having kids. Seriously same boat as you seem to be in lol. A lot of my friends are no longer in the same state so it brought a lot of old friends back together. 

So all that to say that I found that despite the anxiety around the money I wouldn't trade it in. I also took for granted how much gift money helped offset the final cost. For you my advice would be if you want to go ahead with it see if the venue offers some fixed 'per head' pricing. We did that and paid like 150 a head but it was an unlimited open bar, tons of food, apps, etc. Ended up being cheaper despite the sticker shock. And then on top of that consider just asking for cash gifts honestly.

It's a big party where you pay for everything. The only financially responsible wedding is at the courthouse for about $50. 

But that's sad. And you'll have regrets. Especially since you used the phrase ""wedding that I want"". So let's make cuts. 

The only way it gets below 5-10k is if you cut invites to 10% of what you have, keeping it to basically the bridal party and immediate families. No kids.

Just a very nice and exclusive thing. By making BIG cuts you can point disappointed friends to the fact that even Aunt Elouise didn't get an invite, and she was your Godmother. Anyone that doesn't get it isn't worth having as a friend anyway. 

But that's probably not what you want either. Unfortunately, 20k is about right for an ""invite everyone"" wedding.

However, I see in your post about going to a bar with a food and beverage minimum. Rookie mistake. Look into renting rooms at community centers and churches. Those usually go for maybe $1k for the room for a day or two. Then you can do whatever you want in that venue.

Including:

 - Hiring your own caterer that will serve better food at half the price than a venue. Or get some family/friends to do it for even cheaper. 
 - Stocking your own bar with everyone's favorite booze. Do the math. Buying 1 bottle of everyone's favorite brand-nams booze is probably still cheaper than what the bar was charging you. Folks can serve themselves or you can pay someone cash  to play bartender.
 - Make your own decorations. 
 - Don't do dancing. Music and DJ requirements (and cost) go way down.
 - Cut the photographer. But also, don't because nobody will take the good pictures you're hoping for. 

When you're parting everything out, you can negotiate everything. No bullshit rules or min/max stuff. Just cash for goods and services.

It's more work on your end, but you'll spend about 25-30% less and the $15k you do spend will feel like you spent $40k.",wedding definition financially irresponsible big party pay everything financially responsible wedding courthouse thats sad youll regret especially since used phrase wedding want let make cut way get k cut invite keeping basically bridal party immediate family kid nice exclusive thing making big cut point disappointed friend fact even aunt elouise didnt get invite godmother anyone doesnt get isnt worth friend anyway thats probably want either unfortunately k right invite everyone wedding however see post going bar food beverage minimum rookie mistake look renting room community center church usually go maybe k room day two whatever want venue including hiring caterer serve better food half price venue get familyfriends even cheaper stocking bar everyones favorite booze math buying bottle everyones favorite brandnams booze probably still cheaper bar charging folk serve pay someone cash play bartender make decoration dont dancing music dj requirement cost go way cut photographer also dont nobody take good picture youre hoping youre parting everything negotiate everything bullshit rule minmax stuff cash good service work end youll spend less k spend feel like spent k

You have sent out invites, but how many of them have RSVP'd?  Since you've already sent out invites it's not really possible to cut back on the number of people without canceling the whole thing and replanning. So a venue change with more flexible options for food and booze is the next best thing. I'm assuming you've done tons of research in your area already, so is there a cheaper option? Try places that don't require a lot of extra decorations. Think zoos, botanical gardens, parks, lakes, beaches, ranches, meadows, etc. The natural beauty is your decor. 

Food is hard to cheap out on and still be good. So if you want to go cheap have fun with it. Do your favorite junk foods, maybe a taco bar, pizza, etc. If you want to do plated, spaghetti and meatballs is cheap. For dessert sundae bars are a huge hit. When it comes to booze, limit the options. 1 or 2 types of beer, a signature cocktail and a simple red or white wine.

Flowers are the biggest waste of money in my opinion. Get your bouquet and your husband's flowers and that's it. No one cares about flowers or centerpieces. 

Don't try to DJ. Everyone always thinks this is easy, just make a playlist, buts it never works out. DJs are cheap in the grand scheme of things and are like the MCs for the entire wedding.

My comparisons were in different zoning districts (lower density than mine) and they didn't abut a commercial district as mine does, there's were not in a flood plain as mine was, and they made the tiniest adjustments for things - $500 bucks because I don't have a garage, $250 because my roof is old. So find all the reasons that their comps are bad.

2. Compare your house not just to recently sold houses, but to neighbors. My neighbor had an entire new basement put in under their house and they were valued about $1500 less than mine, most other things being equal. I called shenanigans on that and got knocked down about 20k from what they had proposed. Also point out how terrible your neighbors are - the weeds, the 350 small block in the yard, the peeling paint. Nobody wants to live in your house because the neighborhood is terrible!

There's no harm in appealing unless there is some reason that they might UP your valuation, so if you've done some renovations or installed a nice granite countertop, weigh the cost/benefit before doing something. First time I appealed, my sewer line had just busted and the basement smelled of literal shit. Took the assessor down there, pointed out I was going to have to burn 10k on 80 ft of new sewer line under the street and he just said okay, we're good, and my valuation increase (50%) dropped by more than half, saving me about 20k in valuation. THIS year, the county got some decent comps, I've replaced the sewer line, and I've done some other work (namely I pushed my bowing foundation back into place) that if the county saw, they'd probably up my valuation so I'm just letting it slide.

The key is to have a reason why the tax assessment for your house is too high.  I use comps from the tax assessors website.  For example, one year they included comps from a new neighborhood next to mine.  Houses in that neighborhood are priced 30-50% higher than my neighborhood, the houses are 10+ years newer, houses are bigger and so are the lots.  I took a map that showed the outline of the HOA where I live and the HOA of the new neighborhood.  I also made a spreadsheet that showed the size of the lots and houses and the age of each house in both HOA.  (all available on the tax assessors website)  Then I went through listings on Zillow and made note of any finishes that were nicer than my house (wood floors, granite counters etc).  I scheduled a hearing and took all my info with me.  The hearing consisted of a panel of 5 people and they all said they appreciated that I came with actual facts and data.  I guess most people just argue that their taxes are too high but don't have a justification for that.

As an aside, the tax assessment for my house is always higher than the listing price of any house in my neighborhood.  My house is average size for the neighborhood, on an average sized lot and the finishes are comparable to other houses built at that time.  

I've also used a professional service.  It was quick and easy and the charged half of what they saved me.  They didn't recover as much as I have on my own behalf though.  

TLDR:  You should appeal if you have a reason for doing so.  If you aren't planning to sell, I can't think of any negative reasons for doing so.  Do your research.  You don't want to appeal and then find out the tax assessor didn't know about a new bedroom etc which leaves you with a higher value.  The requirements are probably on your tax assessors website.",appeal every year usually get reduction key reason tax assessment house high use comp tax assessor website example one year included comp new neighborhood next mine house neighborhood priced higher neighborhood house year newer house bigger lot took map showed outline hoa live hoa new neighborhood also made spreadsheet showed size lot house age house hoa available tax assessor website went listing zillow made note finish nicer house wood floor granite counter etc scheduled hearing took info hearing consisted panel people said appreciated came actual fact data guess people argue tax high dont justification aside tax assessment house always higher listing price house neighborhood house average size neighborhood average sized lot finish comparable house built time ive also used professional service quick easy charged half saved didnt recover much behalf though tldr appeal reason arent planning sell cant think negative reason research dont want appeal find tax assessor didnt know new bedroom etc leaf higher value requirement probably tax assessor website

In my area it works like this. Your house assessment stays the same year over year, assuming you don't do a major renovation that affects the items they use to calculate its value. (for instance i could have a gold plated bathroom, and it affects my house value the same as if it was made out of old newspapers).

Each year they will raise our tax rate a little bit to cover the budget.

Every 10 or so years, the rate will get high enough, that they will then reassess EVERYONE's house. The tax rate then drops to the level needed to cover the budget.

The end result is your assessed home value is sometimes comically under what the house is worth (my house is assessed at about half of what its worth), and your tax rate against it seems comically high, compared to the town next door that just went through a reassessment. 

But even through the reassessment process, your taxes don't change substantially, and its a predictable year over year increase.

Occasionally there are edge cases on some houses where the blanket reassessment isn't nails them, which is when an appeal makes sense.",mentioned assessed value went actual tax go area work like house assessment stay year year assuming dont major renovation affect item use calculate value instance could gold plated bathroom affect house value made old newspaper year raise tax rate little bit cover budget every year rate get high enough reassess everyones house tax rate drop level needed cover budget end result assessed home value sometimes comically house worth house assessed half worth tax rate seems comically high compared town next door went reassessment even reassessment process tax dont change substantially predictable year year increase occasionally edge case house blanket reassessment isnt nail appeal make sense

Welcome to the housing market.

In terms of an appeal, assessment is all formula based, so unless there's some incorrect information about your house being fed into the calculation there's nothing to actually appeal. 

The most common thing homeowners can actually do to lower an assessment is make sure that ""unimprovable"" sections of their lot are noted and adjusted for. Example: if your property abuts a waterway or wetland, that portion of the property is usually protected and you have to leave it in it's natural state. Thus it's discounted on the assessment compared to normal land.",going k year welcome housing market term appeal assessment formula based unless there incorrect information house fed calculation there nothing actually appeal common thing homeowner actually lower assessment make sure unimprovable section lot noted adjusted example property abuts waterway wetland portion property usually protected leave natural state thus discounted assessment compared normal land

Appeals generally have no impact beyond property taxes. I have appealed more or less successfully three times in the past ten years, and there has not been any downside.

In my area there are two steps - first you submit a written appeal (online) to the appraisers office, basically just a number plus a short letter and any comps you want to use to justify the number. Then they reject your offer, or make a tiny concession that you reject, and then you take it in person to a Board of Equalization - BoE, which is private citizens from your county. 

My experience is that the BoE is happy to listen to any well thought through evaluations of the property value. Many people don't show up, so just being there and presenting information reasonably is a plus.

Once I solidly won my appeal - valuation went up by 10k instead of 80k. Once they split the difference between our two positions, and once I reduced the increase by about 10k.

And in each case, the county is blocked from raising that value again for three years in my state. So even that $10k one was worth it to postpone the impact of the rapid rise the last few years. You can appeal again before 3 years if prices fall fast, but that opens the door to it going up or down again.

The county generally has to provide you with their comparables in advance if you contact the appraisers office and request them. I have used that to do some research and challeng the comparability of the appraisers choices - in each case, I found the best ones from his list (matched my house the closest), pointed out how the others were not as close, and used that $/sqft number on my house to argue for the lower number.

In my state revaluations are done extremely infrequently. The state started mandating it be done, so my town did one to update 30 year old values to modern equivalencies. Our home's value went up more than I believed was correct, so I asked the revaluation agency for our properties detailed sheet, which showed all the metrics by which they came to the valuation. We had let the assessor into our home to ensure accuracy (which was a mistake, btw- he was wholly uninterested in verification of anything. He stood at the door threshold and asked ""so this is a 3bd 2ba?"" It's actually a 4bd 4 bath, which I told him because I had no idea he had no interest in checking). Anyway... our basement's finished sq footage figure was like triple what it should have been, even though I specifically pointed out the sizing to the assessor while they were on site. Our town's personal tax assessor (not the agency hired to do the reval) came out, verified the measurements in the basement and submitted the tax appeal on my behalf. We saved ourselves almost $1500 a YEAR in taxes.   


Maybe start by calling our town's tax assessor and ask what the process is for an appeal. Keep in mind that if specific measurement situations like mine are not at play, then you will have to back up your argument with sales figures (comps) to make your case. Be sure it's a good case.

She does both residential and commercial.

*Generally speaking* you'll present the information you have to the company you're working with.  They will have someone on staff who can run comps, I.E. comparisons, to recent sales in your area.  If everything around is selling for less, they'll probably have a good case.  If it's selling for more, they'll tell you.  If you are a good candidate for appeal, you'll move forward.

From there it escapes my knowledge base a little bit.  Generally speaking they'll initiate a conversation with the appropriate government body (counties, here in NY) and see if the counterparty makes an offer of some kind on reducing the taxes.

Generally speaking, if you successfully win your grievance, a percentage (I think it's 50% in most cases) goes to the company and you get the rest.

So it's an imperfect system, but it might be worth it.  Wishing you well!

Instead, try using it as an example of how capable you are. They ask for a redistribution of tasks *and* a raise or promotion. I.e. ""I'm currently doing 4 jobs. Most people can't do that, if I left you'd have to pay four separate people just to replace me. Now this isnt sustainable, and i dont want to have to go work somewhere else because i like working for you, so we need to talk solutions. But you should also pay me more *because I'm worth it.* I'm a fucking bargain for what I bring to the table.""

That's how you get more money from your boss. But honestly? It's still a lot easier to just apply to a different company and get a better job.",inappropriate effective also want pay money tell good idea thing expensive using reason ask money essentially play pity ie want give money life hard shit thing expensive business cost rising cant afford pay want pay need show value done company outperforming personal impact make justifies paying random employee thing youre better random employee would kind crazy pay wouldnt show make valuable id crazy give raise dont want thinking going somewhere else dont ask anything answer question youre overworked burning dont ask raise money wont solve problem even pay twice much youll still miserable overworked instead try using example capable ask redistribution task raise promotion ie im currently job people cant left youd pay four separate people replace isnt sustainable dont want go work somewhere else like working need talk solution also pay im worth im fucking bargain bring table thats get money bos honestly still lot easier apply different company get better job

Whether it results in an actual increase is another matter. Fact is, many companies these days are struggling too and simply can't afford to give everyone a raise to compensate for inflation. Instead people are being let go.

I'm in fairly frequent contact with my superiors regarding my opinion of each team members' strengths/weaknesses and overall how strong they are.

We wouldn't get rid of someone merely because that person requested a raise but I could easily see a situation where the word comes back ""Sorry, we can't do it"", inflation or not.

I very strongly advocate for a compensation increase above the rate of inflation.  I do not feel like any compensation below the rate of inflation serves as a reward or a motivator to anyone who understands that their purchasing power is eroded by inflation.  If inflation is 5% and you offer a 4% raise, that will be perceived as a 1% pay cut by the employee.  It is hard to tell someone, “You did a great job this year, so we’re going to cut your pay by 1%”.

The fear others may feel is that such an increase is unbudgeted or sets a precedent that can’t be sustainable.  I simply argue that budgets should reflect inflation, and if we missed the mark in planning the budget, we need to go through the pain of adjusting the budget.

Your employer may prefer to remove the risk of the compensation increase by providing a higher variable compensation component (bonus, commission), so that in lean years the increased salaries don’t harm the business.  As an employer, I won’t do this because I feel the bare minimum ever offered should be the same as inflation, but for some people it may be preferable.

Just a little insight into how things might work across the table.

Long story short, you should discuss inflation, you should communicate that anything less than inflation is a pay cut, and if that is not possible, you should angle for a higher variable component as a last resort.",dont currently employee sit board decide compensation general manager strongly advocate compensation increase rate inflation feel like compensation rate inflation serf reward motivator anyone understands purchasing power eroded inflation inflation offer raise perceived pay cut employee hard tell someone great job year going cut pay fear others may feel increase unbudgeted set precedent cant sustainable simply argue budget reflect inflation missed mark planning budget need go pain adjusting budget employer may prefer remove risk compensation increase providing higher variable compensation component bonus commission lean year increased salary dont harm business employer wont feel bare minimum ever offered inflation people may preferable little insight thing might work across table long story short discus inflation communicate anything less inflation pay cut possible angle higher variable component last resort

I can’t imagine how hard it is to scramble with an intimidating financial situation while you’re still grieving.

I agree your mom cannot afford a $3k mortgage even if she can increase her hours and get up to $48k in income.

It seems to me, from an outsiders perspective, that your main options are this:

1) She sells her current home and buys something smaller, ideally somewhere reasonably close to both you and her work that will suit her needs for the indefinite future and can be the last place she’ll ever need to move into. I don’t know what a condo goes for in Seattle but it sounds like she could potentially be up by a few hundred thousand on the current house after selling which would go a long way towards that next home. If she can end up owning a house outright, social security will take her a long way even without much in the way of savings. 1b -Alternately, sell and rent but the that puts her on a bit of a ticking clock where it seems like savings could eventually turn into a problem later in retirement.

2) You both sell both of your homes and find a place that will work for a multi-generation family. It would suck to give up your current low interest rate mortgage as you point out. Also something like this is a huge decision with a lot of pros and cons that are more the purview of r/relationships 

3) You sell your house and move in with your mom, taking on part of the mortgage. This could also get messy for similar reasons to #2

Really sorry for your loss OP. This is a horrible situation. Im not like a genius or anything, but just from an outside perspective these seem to be the main options. Maybe someone else will see something I can’t. Your mom is really lucky to have a kid who is so concerned with her well-being

Once she is in, established and gets through the mourning period, you can all sit down and come up with a plan for the future. She'll have 2-300k in the bank following the home sale and assuming 1 bedroom rents are roughly 2k a month she could live there for 10+ years just on the proceeds from the house. Now that's not to say that's the plan for the rest of her life but the point is, there's no immediate need to make a lifelong decision.

As a future CPA, you will face this many times, with many of your clients.  This is a practice session that will help you to help lots of other people throughout your professional life.  So, let's look at assets, investments, employment and Social Security planning and taxes.

Under the terms of the mortgage, is your mother allowed to rent the house out?  If so, is there a rental market in the area that would support your mother renting the house out for $4K monthly?  This would allow her to keep the house, build equity and, hopefully, also see the value increase.  Alternatively, can the house be reconfigured so that part of it can be rented out for $3K monthly while your mother lives there?  If this is not possible, the best alternative may be selling the house and buying a studio condo or something similar in an area like Renton, as another commenter stated.  A reverse mortgage (I've done them for clients) is not recommended.  Your mother needs to maximize what she has and gain more.

Consolidate the small amount of investments and put them into something safe.  Get your mother into the 401K in her workplace and have her max out what she can put away.  

If mom is an RN or an LVN, she should consider working in a hospital at higher pay than what she would get working as a school nurse.  The vision might be work 3 12-hour shifts weekly and make a great deal more than she does now.  If this isn't to her liking, she needs to find a clinic or other practice to move into that will provide her with a significant income increase.  If Kaiser is located in the Seattle area, that could be good to try.  Or working for a pediatric specialist MD.

Social Security should be put off until she is 70 if possible.  So, work until 70, qualify for a much higher Social Security benefit, then look at retirement - which in her case might mean she works 1 or 2 days weekly for the income and to keep her license up.  Get a Social Security report that tells her what her current input into the system has been, and also find out your dad's SSA benefit.  You're looking to max out your mother's benefits.  Does it make sense for her to take early benefits?  Does it make sense for her to claim your dad's SSA record so that she is bumped up to what he received?

I agree with others about selling the house being Priority #1. Even if she's pretty frugal this change will require a downsize. Re-calculate her monthly income and try to find something where the rental or mortgage payment stays around 30% of her take-home pay. Preferably something in a community where she can stay on the 1st floor as she gets older (duplex, apartment). This may be do-able if the profit from the house can be a large down payment. She needs to use the life insurance for savings, and to be adding to that as well for retirement. Hopefully she would get retirement from her job, but savings are usually still needed.

I'm sure it'll be hard for her to leave her home, but better to do it now when she has the funds to make it happen than to put if off until the situation becomes desperate.",suck grief take backseat business death person dad died youre good child focusing helping mom im sorry loss hopefully plan answer take step back grieve needed agree others selling house priority even shes pretty frugal change require downsize recalculate monthly income try find something rental mortgage payment stay around takehome pay preferably something community stay st floor get older duplex apartment may doable profit house large payment need use life insurance saving adding well retirement hopefully would get retirement job saving usually still needed im sure itll hard leave home better fund make happen put situation becomes desperate

First, as someone with a kid and parents close, don't underestimate the value of having family nearby. There is a point in life you want to distance yourself from your parents, but when kids come in the picture (assuming you have a good relationship) it can be a benefit. So look on that part as a positive. 

You need to take a whole view of your Mom's current and future situation. She's still a few years away from her full retirement age (should be 65 or 66 for her IIRC) and I'd advise to plan to hold out as soon as she can. Does she get survivor SS benefits from your dad in addition to her working? I would get someone to look at the best option for her on when/how to get the max SS benefits. 

I think as others said, there may be enough equity in the home to make this easier. I would see what's available near you (condo or otherwise) that she can buy outright with teh proceeds from the house. I know prices are crazy, and that may not be possible, but there's a world where she could get \~ $250K is looks like from the house. Even with a small mortgage that could be very doable with her income. 

Agree, unfortunately, she should up her hours if possible. 

Otherwise, I don't think there is much to do. Sell the house, move closer, try to find something that gets her to a $0 or close to $0 mortgage, BANK any life insurance to give her some savings, and then work with an accountant to figure out the best way to maximize her SS benefits.

Renting at her age and income is actually a good idea. And, you will not be the one fixing little things all the time. And, if she's in a 55+ place, you will be less responsible for her social life - which can get old after a while if she's leaning on you for socializing.

Make sure she knows to not spend more than she can pay off each month on her one or two credit cards (get rid of the rest). And, only one car.

Be sure she is clear on how to budget, even setting up a basic spreadsheet to go over with her ever two weeks to make sure she's living within her means.

Your mom is eligible for your dad's Social Security when she is ready to take social security, I think. I know that's true for widows already on SS.

Good luck.",sell house move apartment rent lower ready made group friend move mom disabled sister apartment resisted first loved could ususally find someone talk walking hall downstairs etc place football watching party crafting group sort activity mom could start one wanted renting age income actually good idea one fixing little thing time shes place less responsible social life get old shes leaning socializing make sure know spend pay month one two credit card get rid rest one car sure clear budget even setting basic spreadsheet go ever two week make sure shes living within mean mom eligible dad social security ready take social security think know thats true widow already s good luck

Definitely sell the house.  Put it on the Market tomorrow.  

The current mortgage rates are fine.  They are not the amazing rates of a few years ago, but they are still lower than the historical average. 

Having grandma close by to babysit for free while you and your wife work will more than pay for whatever adjustments you need to make.  Childcare is obscenely expensive.  Plus she has at least $200k in property profit and a portion of it could be used to contribute to the new house, with the rest setup with a metered payout of CDs or iBonds so they can earn some interest above any checking account inflation (like a 6 month, 1yr, 2yr, 5yr...).  

My Inlaws have always lived less than five minutes away and for the last 5 years they have been living in the basement of the house we bought with the intention to convert that space to an apartment for them.  It has a bedroom and full bath and the bar was easy to convert into a full kitchen.  And the unfinished space is now a huge woodshop.  They pay a monthly ""rent"" contribution to the family finances, we pay all utilities, the house is nearly always occupied and the kid doesn't have to hang out with a stranger before or after school.  And I actually see them less than I did back when they had to drive over to watch the kid. 
Since it's your mother and not your wife's, you will be responsible for setting boundaries and ensuring she sticks to your kid's routine, not just re-does whatever ""worked for you"".  Don't let your wife be the bad guy.  

Two of my wife's cousins have also done the same with their parents.

Unfortunately school nursing is just about the lowest paid employment for an RN.  However, if that’s all she’s comfortable with, she could shop around at other school districts and/or work at camps during the summer.

Some commenters suggested employment in a hospital and/or travel nursing. However unless your mom was very recently employed in a hospital setting I’d say that would be very difficult if not impossible. But there are many other options!

She could work peds home health or hospice, either through an agency or private duty.  

Telephone triage/advice nurse for a pediatric clinic (some may want a background in ER/urgent care).

Insurance claims review (would require computer skills)

Instructor at a local nursing school, esp if she has at least a BSN. She could help with skills labs, simulations, or clinical instruction.

In a HCOL area like Seattle, I’m guessing she could make at least $25-35/hr as a nanny or night nurse/postpartum doula.

Finally she could teach CPR and/or childbirth education classes.

These scenarios are truly nightmares, but I think you have a lot of hope that your mom will not be left in a bad situation. 

I would go with her to meet with a financial planner. Perhaps she may have access to one through her school district. My mom is a teacher, and she always met with one through her union. Idk if your mom has union representation, but if she does, that'd be a good starting point. They can dig more into her possible SS income, etc. Does she have any sort of pension being a school employee? If so, would she lose some of that if she were to move in with you temporarily and take a job close to you instead?

Unless you and your spouse could and would be willing to move in with your mom and/or sell or rent your place, I think your mom should sell her home. From an optimistic standpoint, this is a great time of year to be gearing up for a sale, and good realtors have experience in this area and could make this a smooth(er) transition for her. I feel really bad, though, that not only did she lose her husband, but she likely will be out her house soon, too. A super alternate would be that she could rent some rooms out, but that's a setup that is very particular, market-dependent (is she near a local university?) and you have to be mentally prepared as a landlord. All things she may not be up for as a grieving spouse.

Nurses continue to be in high demand, even substitute school nurses. Perhaps she could move in with you and find work as a personal care worker through the county or a private agency. She might earn a much higher income doing so. But it definitely sucks to leave your routine, so if she can keep working where she is for the next year or so, that would probably be best for her well-being. She may really need her work and colleagues as a distraction right now.

My grandma (who was 63 when she lost my grandpa, who was 76) was a home health care worker through the county part-time at that point and continued to work until she was 75 (probably should've retired a bit earlier, but she did it). My sister and I were very little then, and my parents ultimately moved closer to her around that time. I am sure having us in her life more regularly (she picked us up from elementary school every day until my mom was done with work) was a big boost to her mental health after my grandpa passed. I know you can't predict the future, but I am sure when you and your wife are ready to start a family, your mother will be delighted to be close to you and will have something positive to focus on.",op im sorry loss dad scenario truly nightmare think lot hope mom left bad situation would go meet financial planner perhaps may access one school district mom teacher always met one union idk mom union representation thatd good starting point dig possible s income etc sort pension school employee would lose move temporarily take job close instead unless spouse could would willing move mom andor sell rent place think mom sell home optimistic standpoint great time year gearing sale good realtor experience area could make smoother transition feel really bad though lose husband likely house soon super alternate would could rent room thats setup particular marketdependent near local university mentally prepared landlord thing may grieving spouse nurse continue high demand even substitute school nurse perhaps could move find work personal care worker county private agency might earn much higher income definitely suck leave routine keep working next year would probably best wellbeing may really need work colleague distraction right grandma lost grandpa home health care worker county parttime point continued work probably shouldve retired bit earlier sister little parent ultimately moved closer around time sure u life regularly picked u elementary school every day mom done work big boost mental health grandpa passed know cant predict future sure wife ready start family mother delighted close something positive focus

It’s a sad reality. 

Alternatively, she sells the house, you sell your house, she goes in on the new house with you, and the equity she put into your house is your payment for taking care of her once she passes in hopefully 100 or more years. Also, if she does manage to retire, free babysitting 😜.

If you ever move you will want her to stay close to you. You may even buy a bigger home in a couple years and want her to move in with you. Or she may want to move to a senior living community or she may need assisted living services. A house is great if you want to put down roots and live in it for 5+ years.

What condition is the house in?  Does it need a lot of repairs or has any recent work been done to it?

Another angle to look at it is to turn the house into a rental.  Can the house fetch enough to cash flow on the property from a tenant, maybe another family?  Can an ADU be added to the property so she can live in the ADU and the main house rented?  That way equity is still being built while the mortgage is covered.

New jobs mean new withholding (W-4). Fill out a W-4, check you spouse's as well, and you need to use option 2a, 2b, or 2c for each. If your jobs are in the same Single tax bracket just do 2c and you'll be fine. After that I'd recommend 2b since we're early enough in the year to not worry about 2a, the only option that takes YTD withholding into account, but it's hard to use.

This is in line with what Werewolfdad suggests. You probably skipped over this important step so your new job assumes your spouse doesn't work, so they assume that your spouse's income just doesn't exist and add to your tax liability.

What was your compensation target at the old job vs the new? How much were you actually paid at the old job vs the new? When exactly did you leave the old job and start the new job? Did the old job pay out PTO? What are your deductions like? Unless you are taking the standard deduction (you mentioned a refinance so sounds like you’re itemizing) they almost certainly arent the same this year as last year… Etc.

The details are important and giving the amounts as a lump sum loses those details.

A +25-30k increase in income is a pretty big jump, even if it was “the only change.” Note the number of changes in situation mean pretty much nothing, only the number of full dollars… so your “only change” was actually 25,000+. Possibly more since a job change also means new benefits+costs and a raise usually means more dollars going into a retirement account even if the percentage is the same.


One of the more likely scenarios that plays out is that the new job started withholding in April as if you had no income from January-April.

Making an assumption that your $101k in income in 2021 was evenly distributed between you and your wife, this would have resulted in the new job only taxing you as if your combined income for the year would have been $104k instead of $129k (before capital losses).

That’s 25k that would have likely fallen in the 22% income tax bracket which is $5500 owed.

Of course Job 1 withheld some monies on the 12-16k you made with them but it was likely only around $1500. Which leaves you still with a net tax due of $4000.

One thing most people don't understand is the withholding tables have been long screwed up. The 2017 tax law changes tried to update the withholding tables a bit, but it's still far from realistic, especially when many MFJ couples are basically dual income where both spouses are making substantial money (not like one spouse making $60k and the other making only $10k).

I've seen people blame Bush, Obama, Trump, Biden, but really it's just that the withholding tables are still living the 50s where you had a single breadwinner.

The easiest thing for couples to do is basically continue withholding as single if they both make roughly equal money--even like $80k vs $100k I think is probably pretty safe. If you get excited that you're married and both switch to MFJ, that's when you'll severely underhold and then find yourself paying a major tax bill. If you really want to change to MFJ on your W4 then make sure you go through the worksheet (2b) or at a minimum if you're both working, the 2c option is just like the old 2019 and earlier W4 which had a ""Married but withhold at higher single rate"" option.

Bottom line is since the MFJ tax brackets is basically double of the single bracket (at least through $500k or $600k, which covers the vast majority of Americans), simply checking this option in 2c won't be too far off for most families with both spouses working.",changing w married filing jointly greatly change tax withholding one thing people dont understand withholding table long screwed tax law change tried update withholding table bit still far realistic especially many mfj couple basically dual income spouse making substantial money like one spouse making k making k ive seen people blame bush obama trump biden really withholding table still living single breadwinner easiest thing couple basically continue withholding single make roughly equal moneyeven like k v k think probably pretty safe get excited youre married switch mfj thats youll severely underhold find paying major tax bill really want change mfj w make sure go worksheet b minimum youre working c option like old earlier w married withhold higher single rate option bottom line since mfj tax bracket basically double single bracket least k k cover vast majority american simply checking option c wont far family spouse working
